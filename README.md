# CmpFetch
A minimalistic, simple program like fastfetch. I've been learning C for three days now, and I've written this minimalistic program that resembles fastfetch (I'm using a translator).
# Using
To begin with, it is written for the Android system and it will not work on other systems. To change the output of CmpFetch, you only need to modify a portion of the code. Don't worry, there are hints and a few examples provided. I'm new to C, so please forgive any mistakes
