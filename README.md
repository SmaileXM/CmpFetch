# CmpFetch
A minimalistic, simple program like fastfetch. I've been learning C for three days now, and I've written this minimalistic program that resembles fastfetch (I'm using a translator).
# Config
The config is changed through the config.c and config.h files, after which the program must be recompiled
# Using
Compile 
```
gcc -o cmpfetch main.c config.c
mv cmpfetch /usr/bin
```
Run
```
cmpfetch
```
